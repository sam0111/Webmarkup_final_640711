      <h4 class="title">About Haarlem Center</h4>


      <p class="p1">Haarlem is the capital of the province Noord-Holland. It is one of the most important
        cities of The Netherlands and during the war between The Netherlands and Spain Haarlem fought
        back strongly against the enemies.
        The city is a nicer version of Amsterdam which is only a short train ride away from Haarlem.
        The center of Haarlem is a 10 minute walk away from Haarlem station.
        Haarlem station is one of the oldest train stations of the netherlands.
        You could take the bus at the station that stops by the center, for example the bus 300
        stops right infront
        the center.</p>

      <p class="p2">The city center used to be known for having the blooming flower district,
        but now it is known for many things
        the hidden court yard "De Hofjes", and its many museums.
        It also has one of the most beautiful and oldest architecture of the Netherlands, which is worth coming
        for. On saturdays you can visit the market which is located at the "Grote Markt" and the "Boter Markt".
        You can get a fresh "Stroopwafel" try some cheeses and many other foods.
        Throughout the seasons there are many events in the center, it might be worth visitng one of those.

      <h4 class="title">Activities in Haarlem Center</h4>


      <p class="p1">
        At first sight you might think theres not a lot to do in the center,but that is not true.
        Though it is a historical town, there are a lot of fun activities to do in the center of Haarlem
        and there is something for everyone, even if it doesn't seem like it, since there is just so much.
      </p>

      <p class="p2">
        You could go shopping or visit the church.
        Or maybe you could go to the museum. Like the Teylers museum, which is the first museum of Haarlem.
        It is a museum about science and art and it was build in 1778. Or you could visit the Frans Hals museum, which
        was build in 1862 and
        it has the art of the "Golden Century" of the netherlands.
        Haarlem Center has many shops in the main road. From stores like H&M and Zara to little boutiques.
        You can buy yourself a whole new outfit in the center or you could find little have to have gizmos.
        And the big church of Haarlem, also known as the Sint Bavo Kerk, is located in the "heart" of center.
        But perhaps you want to visit the new church of Haarlem, which is also worth visiting.
        Or maybe you could just take a walk through city which is also quite nice, especially during the winter
        when the city has put up all the christmas lights and the big christmas tree.

      </p>

      <p class="p3">
        You can go look for the little gems in the allay beside the main path.
        There are many restaurants and cafes too, so you can just take break whenever you feel like it
        and drink some coffee and maybe have a bite. The center of Haarlem has many nice terraces to sit and relax.
        Or maybe you want to have something less PG family friendly, there are many "coffeeshops" you could
        visit, like Willie wortel which is short walk away from the center.
        Most of those shops do not actually sell coffee so be aware.
